    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 x large herrings (fresh optional)</li>
      <li>2x pith helmets</li>
      <li>2x sets of khaki clothing</li>
      <li>A willing partner, approximately your height</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Dress yourself and your willing partner in the khaki clothing.</li>
      <li>Put the pith helmets on both you and your partner.</li>
      <li>Pick herring up in both hands.</li>
      <li>Facing your partner, take two strides backwards away from them.</li>
      <li>
        Lift arms perpendicular to your torso, level with your partner's face.
        Each herring should be hanging parallel to your body.
      </li>
      <li>Separate arms by about 40º (30º if using fan-forced arms).</li>
      <em>n.b.</em>
      your hands must be separated at least enough to allow your partner's
      head to pass between them.
      <li>
        Dance backwards and forwards on tiptoes, bringing hands together when
        your partner's face is in between them, allowing herring to contact
        their cheeks. The contact force should be just enough to cause minor
        annoyance and a soft "slap" noise.
      </li>
      <li>
        Repeat steps 6-7 until asked to stop or slapped with a bigger fish
      </li>
      <li>Enjoy.</li>
