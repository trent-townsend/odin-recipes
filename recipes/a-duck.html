        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>"But a duck is not a fish," I can hear you say. Oh what a poor, unlearned peasant you revealed yourself to
            be.
            Just think about it for a moment.</p>

        <dl>

            <dt><em>Why do fish float?</em></dt>
            <dd>
                <em>Answer</em>: Because they are made of wood.
            </dd>
        </dl>
        <dt><em>What also floats?</em></dt>
        <dd><em>Answer</em>: A duck.</dd>
        <p>Therefore you don't need to be a learned king to realise that eating fish and duck is one in the same thing.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>A Duck</li>
            <li>That is all</li>
            <li>You don't need anything else</li>
            <li>Move along now</li>
        </ul>
</div>
<div class="steps">
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Dispatch your duck using your preferred method (e.g. holy hand grenade)
            <li>Scale/de-feather your duck by dipping into hot water, grasping scales/feather near their base and
                pulling
                firmly</li>
            <li>Repeat step 2 until there all scales/feathers are removed</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 180ÂºC</li>
            <li>Place duck in a large baking tray and cook in oven for 2 hours. <br><strong>Warning:</strong> As
                previously
                mentioned both fish and ducks are made of wood. Caution must used to ensure it is not burnt during the
                cooking process.</li>
            <li>You will know your duck is ready when a meat thermometer can be inserted without the duck replying, "it
                is merely a flesh wound".</li>
            <li>Enjoy</li>
        </ol>
